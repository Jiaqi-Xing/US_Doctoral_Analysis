# US Doctoral Respondents Estimation through 2022 ACS

## Overview

This project estimates the number of doctoral degree holders across U.S. states using the 2022 ACS dataset from IPUMS USA. By applying the Laplace ratio estimator, the analysis compares estimated counts to actual values across states to evaluate the consistency of the ratio-based approach. The project highlights differences in educational attainment across states and the limitations of ratio-based estimations.

-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to clean data.

## Note: 
The raw data file is too large to upload to the GitHub repository. Follow the instructions in the paper to download the data directly from IPUMS USA.
